DoneApp is my simple app to help people build new habits. I build it just to simplify my Challenge app.

  
I love small app, that does only 1 thing, and does it really really well. So, when starting DoneApp, I told myself to keep it simple, and eliminate everything that isn't needed:

  
"NO USER SYSTEM, NO SERVER, NO SOCIAL, NO FANCY UI, 1 VIEW ONLY"

  
It took me 3 days to build DoneApp 1.0\. I love how simple it is and start to use it more and more in my daily.

  
_**When you build something, focus to make it convenient for users, don't try hard to make it fancy.**_

  
PS: If you want to train yourself good habits, try [DoneApp][0].
