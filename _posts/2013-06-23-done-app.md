DoneApp is my simple app to help people build new habits. I build it just to simplify my Challenge app.

  
I love small app, that I only do 1 thing, and do it really really well.

  
When starting DoneApp, I told myself to keep it simple, and eliminate everything that isn't needed:

  
"NO USER SYSTEM, NO SERVER, NO SOCIAL, NO FANCY UI, 1 VIEW ONLY"

  
I also simplify what user can do with the app, very simple
