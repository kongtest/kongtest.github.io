title: What prevents you to be an global citizen
---
_Written in the perspective of a Vietnamese citizen. The main article will be in Vietnamese and share to my Vietnamese friends._

  
What I mean by "Global citizen" is that you have the freedom of where you can go, who you can talk with and where you can stay?

  
When I'm in Singapore, I was so surprised that so many of my friends can go travel to others countries. There are not many of my friends can go travel like that. Then I'm going travel and meet more friends, I'm even more surprised. This gives me idea and motivation to write this post.

  
Travelling is just one aspect of being a global citizen, which is the freedom to go, to make friend with everyone in the world, to learn any new knowledge and skill, to open your business to any people in the world....

  
But how hard for a Vietnamese to do that?

  
1\. Learn languages or at least English

  
2\. Financial Independence

If your family is not rich, you need to have skills to do work and get money. You can learn to be a freelancer: a writer, a software programmer, a designer...

  
3\. Adventurous mind

Don't be scared to go to new place. You need to learn to travel alone.

Being a global citizen is not a certification, you don't need to prove it. Being a global citizen is the confidence in yourself. So let's start with some simple achievement:

- Can you talk with a foreigner?

- Can you go travel alone?

- Can you work as a freelancer?
