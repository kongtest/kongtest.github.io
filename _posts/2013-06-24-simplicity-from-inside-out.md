title: Simplicity from inside out
---
As a developer who build app, I want to write clean code.

  
As a startup's product guy, I want to "move fast and break thing", which means do whatever that ship the product. Usually, the code can be messy.

  
It's true that a startup need to do a lot of testing, to know which solution will work for customers.

  
Move fast and ship the product is very important.

  
But produce a messy code can be a choice in many situations.

  
Sometimes, more features doesn't mean that you can test more. It may get users confused.

  
You need to be very clear on what you want to give to users. Simplify everything to its essentials. Build small features and test how market thinks about it.

The solution need to be clean and simple. The code also need to be simple and clean.

  
Can a clean solution growing from a messy code? No. Simplicity from inside out.

  
This means that tomorrow, I need to refactor my new code. I built a cool, easy to use Reminder feature, with a quite complicated code. I sugar to myself that I make something simple from complicated. No, make it simple from inside out.

  
Ship then simplify.
