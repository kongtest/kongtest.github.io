title: Blog with Evernote
---
This post is written in Evernote, and will automatically publish to my Github blog.

  
Last night, I planned to write a new post about WWDC2013, but was so lazy to starting with Git.

Yes, I'm blogging with the developer-friendly _\`git commit\`_ and _\`git push\`_! My blog is hosted by Github using a static blog generator called Jekyll. And I'm writing in Markdown.

  
I love the simplicity of Jekyll. However, I'm still lazy to starting to write an article. I think, If I can blog just like I take note. Then I will blog more. I write a lot of notes in Evernote. So my idea is, writing note in Evernote and automatically publishing to Github.

  
"[Blog with Evernote][0]" is the result of my last 30 hours. It does exactly what I want, automatically publish my note into a blog post. Good night, everyone!
