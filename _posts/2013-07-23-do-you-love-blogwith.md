title: $ Do you love #BlogWith?
---
I started BlogWith as a quick side project, but it turn out to be super useful for me. That's why I spent a lot more time to make the system better.

I'm planning to set a small fee for using the service. Since I'm working on it daily to make it better for you, I need my work support my living too.

  
If you love BlogWith, let me know if how much you can pay for the service per year? 19.99, 9.99 or 4.99

  
If you love BlogWith, please support it in [Evernote Devcup][0]?
