title: Ask yourself who you want to be in next 5 years?
---
Today, I'm sitting down, breathing and asking myself this question. 

  
What type of person I want to be in next 5 years? What type of work I want to do? 

How will I wake up and spend my day in the way that I feel the most satisfied?  

  
Imagine and see. 

  
I found that this kind of questions helps me sort my life. Pop out my priorities when I need to make choices, but get confused.

It also give me hint what I need to do, when I ask myself, what is the difference of me currently and the imagined me next 5 years?

Will the feeling of having a big company make me happy? Will I be super busy working on business stuff and managing? How about having lots of money and a luxury life? 

Won't. It's not those things. 

  
It's working with great people, inspire and get inspired. It's solving people' problems. It's helping others. It's making good impart on others lives. It's creating value.

If I won't do these things, I won't be happy. Whatever I plan to do, it should aim for this purpose.
